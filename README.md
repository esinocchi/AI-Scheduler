# Lion's Advisor
Lion's Advisor is a tool that students can use to see their potential schedules for the future without the hassle of scheduling an appointment with their adivsor or pouring through countless documents and websites to find the courses and requirements they need to fill.

## Inspiration
Lion's Advisor was inspired by the hassle that we had to go through to figure out the courses that we need to schedule in order to graduate without problems in the future"

## What it does
Lion's Advisor is a site where you can put in your major, your current semester, and what courses you've already scheduled and possible problems you have. Once this information is inputed, we return you a possible schedule for you to follow with classes that you need to take so that you can fulfil all your major requirements.

## How we built it
To build Lion's Advisor, we first set up an integration with Chat-GPT in order to parse our course information for it to analyze. Once that was finished, we started work on our website, trying to make it as intuitive as possible so that use can be widespread.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Implementing Chat-GPT and learning how to work with the API
2. Successfully getting our front-end to interact seamlessly with our back-end
3. Training Chat-GPT on all our information so that it can provide reliable information and schedules

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Successfully implementing the aforementioned challenges we ran into

## What we learned
Exactly how to implement AI into projects and that brainstorming ideas is a lot harder than it seems.

## What's next for Lion's Advisor
We will try to implement all the majors at Penn State, so that the whole school can work seamlessly. Once that is implemented, we will look into scaling into other universities so that course scheduling can stop being a hassle for everyone.
